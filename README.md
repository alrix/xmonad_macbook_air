Xmonad Config for MacBook Air 11
================================

Contains xmonad config optimised for macbook air running Arch Linux.

* Dependencies

dzen2
tint2
conky

* Additional programs referenced in xprofile. 

cbatticon - Monitors the battery and shuts the laptop down if the battery gets too low. I'm only using systemd for power management.

nm-applet - Works in conjunction with NetworkManager to manage network setup. 

redshift - adjusts colour temp of the screen

compton - I use this for the compositor - allows inactive windows to be faded and made transparent. Use the shadow-exclude to work around bugs in tint2.

syndaemon - stop my mouse getting in the way when I don't want to use it.

feh - set the wallpaper

xcalib - calibrage the colour of the screen

xmodmap - I have a UK keyboard which requires some tweaking to swap the grave and tilder keys
